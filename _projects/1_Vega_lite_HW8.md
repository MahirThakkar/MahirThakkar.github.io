## Search The Data & Methods

Below is where we can put some links to both the data and the analysis code as buttons:

```
<div class="left">
{% include elements/button.html link="https://github.com/MahirThakkar/MahirThakkar.github.io/blob/main/assets/json/bar_chart.json" text="The Data" %}
</div>

<div class="right">
{% include elements/button.html link="https://github.com/MahirThakkar/MahirThakkar.github.io/blob/main/python_notebooks/bar_chart.html" text="The Analysis" %}

```
